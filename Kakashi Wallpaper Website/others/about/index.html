                                <h2>Kakashi Hatake</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi
                                    of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
                                    Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi) and the
                                    Copy Ninja (コピー忍者, Kopī Ninja), he is one of Konoha's
                                    most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and
                                    leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility.
                                    To his students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance
                                    of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the
                                    Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After
                                    the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth
                                    Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning:
                                    Sixth Fire Shadow).
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="info">
                                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Because his mother died when he was very young, Kakashi was
                                    raised during his early years by his father, Sakumo. Sakumo
                                    was famed throughout the shinobi world, having saved Konoha
                                    on at least one occasion; Kakashi in particular revered his
                                    father. During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi was
                                    enrolled in Konoha's Ninja Academy - Sakumo made the
                                    decision to save the lives of his teammates rather than
                                    complete the assignment. The mission's failure had
                                    disastrous consequences for the Land of Fire, causing many
                                    in Konoha, including the teammates he saved, to vilify him
                                    for abandoning his duties. Disgraced, Sakumo committed
                                    suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined
                                    not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that
                                    following the Shinobi Rules must always take priority.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="info">
                                <h3>In the Academy</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the Academy, Kakashi earned top grades, earning him
                                    recognition as a prodigy and the best of his generation.
                                    Ultimately, he became very popular amongst his peers. With
                                    his talents soon being recognised, at age 5, Kakashi
                                    graduated from the Academy at the top of his class in a
                                    single year. Upon becoming genin, he and his classmates, Rin
                                    Nohara and Obito, were teamed together under the leadership
                                    of Minato Namikaze. In the anime, Minato gave the team a
                                    bell test at its formation, assigning the three to take the
                                    two bells he kept on his person. Minato often held back less
                                    against the prodigious Kakashi than with Rin and Obito so
                                    they couldn't obtain the bells without teamwork.
                                    Unfortunately, Kakashi realised this, only using Obito and
                                    Rin as a means to an end to obtain the bells. Nonetheless,
                                    Minato passed them because they accomplished the goal of the
                                    test by working as a team. Minato did encourage them to
                                    improve their teamwork afterwards, a message that Obito and
                                    Rin took to heart, but fell upon deaf ears with Kakashi.
                                    Team Minato would go on many missions during its career, but
                                    Kakashi's devotion to the rules often made him difficult to
                                    work with; Obito, already jealous of Kakashi's natural
                                    talent and popularity, was frequently at odds with him about
                                    this behaviour. At age 6, Konoha officials allowed Kakashi
                                    to compete in the Chūnin Exams with his team, which he
                                    passed by defeating Might Guy and became a chūnin.

                                <h3>Third Shinobi World War</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Konoha eventually became embroiled in the Third Shinobi
                                    World War. As part of the war effort, Team Minato was
                                    assigned to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in Kusagakure in
                                    order to cut off Iwagakure's supply line. Minato was needed
                                    on the front lines at the time, leaving Kakashi, recently
                                    promoted to jōnin at age 12, in charge. Before embarking on
                                    the mission, Minato and Rin gave him presents to celebrate
                                    his promotion; Obito forgot to get him anything. Shortly
                                    after entering Kusa, they encountered an Iwa-scout, Mahiru.
                                    Kakashi tried to eliminate him with his new jutsu, Chidori,
                                    but the attack speed left him vulnerable to counter-attack,
                                    forcing Minato to step in, save Kakashi, and kill Mahiru
                                    himself. Before leaving them, Minato advised Kakashi to not
                                    use the Chidori again.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>ANBU Career</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Because he'd lost two teammates in such a short timespan,
                                    his role in Rin's death, and his failure to honour Obito's
                                    last request by protecting her, Kakashi dropped into a
                                    depression. In the anime, many believed he purposely killed
                                    Rin to prevent her from leaking information, earning him the
                                    nickname "Friend-Killer Kakashi". Many, especially those in
                                    Anbu believed he would kill a comrade without hesitation if
                                    it was for the sake of completing the mission. He would also
                                    spend his days avoiding friends and former classmates and at
                                    night he would be haunted by dreams of himself killing Rin
                                    again. Minato, now the new Hokage, tried to help Kakashi
                                    emerge from the darkness he'd fallen into after Obito and
                                    Rin's deaths by assigning him to the Anbu in order to have
                                    him close in an attempt to alleviate his pain.
